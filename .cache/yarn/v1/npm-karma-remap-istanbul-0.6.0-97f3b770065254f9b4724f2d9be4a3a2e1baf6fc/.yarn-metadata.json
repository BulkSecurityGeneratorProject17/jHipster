    "readme": "# karma-remap-istanbul\nCall remap-istanbul as a karma reporter, enabling remapped reports on watch\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall `karma-remap-istanbul` as a dev-dependency in your project.\n\n```bash\nnpm install karma-remap-istanbul --save-dev\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nAdd the plugin, reporter and reporter configuration in your `karma.conf.js`.\n\n```js\n{\n  plugins: ['karma-remap-istanbul'],\n  reporters: ['progress', 'karma-remap-istanbul'],\n  remapIstanbulReporter: {\n    remapOptions: {}, //additional remap options\n    reportOptions: {}, //additional report options\n    reports: {\n      lcovonly: 'path/to/output/coverage/lcov.info',\n      html: 'path/to/output/html/report'\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Example configuration with `karma-coverage`\n```js\n{\n  preprocessors: {\n    'build/**/!(*spec).js': ['coverage']\n  },\n  plugins: ['karma-remap-istanbul', 'karma-coverage'],\n  reporters: ['progress', 'coverage', 'karma-remap-istanbul'],\n  remapIstanbulReporter: {\n    reports: {\n      html: 'coverage'\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou will need to either install `karma-coverage` and configure it as a preprocessor for your transpiled modules under test or instrument the modules under test as part of your build process (i.e. via a tool like webpack and the `sourcemap-istanbul-instrumenter-loader`). If the latter option is chosen, the coverage statistics will need to be stored by the build tool on the `__coverage__` global variable (istanbul's default) or karma will not transmit the coverage back to the runner. For a full e2e example please [look here](https://github.com/marcules/karma-remap-istanbul/tree/master/examples/webpack).\n\n## Alternatives\nFor some build tools there are better suited solutions than using this module.\n* babel users can use the [babel plugin](https://github.com/istanbuljs/babel-plugin-istanbul) as it doesn't rely on sourcemapping and so is less error prone and more accurate\n* system.js users can use [systemjs-istanbul](https://github.com/guybedford/systemjs-istanbul) as it has remap-istanbul support included\n* browserify users can use [karma-typescript](https://github.com/monounity/karma-typescript) as it has remap-istanbul support included\n* webpack users can use the [instanbul-instrumenter-loader](https://github.com/deepsweet/istanbul-instrumenter-loader) and the [karma-coverage-instanbul-reporter](https://github.com/mattlewis92/karma-coverage-istanbul-reporter)\n",
