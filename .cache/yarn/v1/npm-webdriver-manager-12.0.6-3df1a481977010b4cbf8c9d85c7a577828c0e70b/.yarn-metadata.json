This is the same tool as `webdriver-manager` from the [Protractor](https://github.com/angular/protractor) repository.\n\n**Note:** Version 9 and lower please reference [pose/webdriver-manager](https://github.com/pose/webdriver-manager). If there are features that existed in version 9 and lower, please open up an issue with the missing feature or a create a pull request.\n\nGetting Started\n---------------\n\n```\nnpm install -g webdriver-manager\n```\n\nSetting up a Selenium Server\n----------------------------\n\nPrior to starting the selenium server, download the selenium server jar and driver binaries. By default it will download the selenium server jar and chromedriver binary.\n\n```\nwebdriver-manager update\n```\n\nStarting the Selenium Server\n----------------------------\n\nBy default, the selenium server will run on `http://localhost:4444/wd/hub`.\n\n\n```\nwebdriver-manager start\n```\n\nOther useful commands\n---------------------\n\nView different versions of server and driver files:\n\n```\nwebdriver-manager status\n```\n\nClear out the server and driver files. If `webdriver-manager start` does not work, try to clear out the saved files.\n\n```\nwebdriver-manager clean\n```\n\nRunning / stopping server in background process (stopping is not yet supported on standalone server 3.x.x):\n\n```\nwebdriver-manager start --detach\nwebdriver-manager shutdown\n```\n\nHelp commands\n-------------\n\nWedriver-manager has a main help option: `webdriver-manager help`. There are also other built in help menus for each of the commands. So for example, if you would like to look up all the flag options you can set in `update`, you could run `webdriver-manager update help`.\n\nHere are a list of all the commands with help:\n\n```\nwebdriver-manager update help\nwebdriver-manager start help\nwebdriver-manager clean help\nwebdriver-manager status help\n```\n\nOther topics:\n--------------\n\n- [mobile browser support](docs/mobile.md)\n- [protractor support](docs/protractor.md)\n- [set specific versions](docs/versions.md)",
