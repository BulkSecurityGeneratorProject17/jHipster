    "readme": "# karma-intl-shim\n\n> A Karma shim for the `Intl` for internationalization\n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm install karma-intl-shim --save-dev\n```\n\n## Usage \n\nIn your `karma.conf.js` file, add `intl-shim` to the `frameworks` in your `config.set`:\n\n```\nconfig.set({\n  frameworks: [\"intl-shim\"],\n```\n\nYou may need to also require it in your `plugins` array:\n\n```\nplugins: [\n  require(\"karma-intl-shim\")\n  ]\n```\n\nNow when running `karma`, you should not get an error that `Intl` cannot be found.\n\n## Issues\n\nThis shim simply attaches the `Intl` library to the window so it's available for testing. \n\nIf you have issues, it's most likely an issue with [`anyearnshaw/Intl.js`](https://github.com/andyearnshaw/Intl.js), issues for the Intl project can be reported [here](https://github.com/andyearnshaw/Intl.js/issues).\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease create a new issue if you find that you have an issue unrelated to `Intl` under [karma-intl-shim](https://github.com/chaseadamsio/karma-intl-shim/issues/new).\n\nPlease submit a PR if you have made a modification. PRs will be reviewed within a 72 hour week day period of the initial PR.\n\n### Why is it webpacked?\n\nThis project is built with webpack because the `shim.js` is injected into the browser, which we all know doesn't have a \"require\" and this is an easy way to do that.\n",
