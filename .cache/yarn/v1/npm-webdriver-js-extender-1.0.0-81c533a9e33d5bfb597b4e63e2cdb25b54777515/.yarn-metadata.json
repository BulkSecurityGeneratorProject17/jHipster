    "readme": "WebDriver JS Extender\n=====================\n\nThis tools extends [Selenium's javascript implementation](\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/selenium-webdriver) of the WebDriver API\nto include additional commands (e.g. commands required for [appium](\nhttps://github.com/appium/appium)).\n\nCurrently, few commands are implemented.  But the groundwork has been laid,\nfuture commands should be easy to add, and PRs are very welcome!  See\n[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nIf you are using a versoin of `selenium-webdriver` below `3.0.0-beta-1`, you\nmust use the `patch()` function before you create your webdriver instance:\n\n```js\nrequire('webdriver-js-extender').patch(\n    require('selenium-webdriver/lib/command'),\n    require('selenium-webdriver/executors'),\n    require('selenium-webdriver/http'));\n```\n\nOnce you've patched `selenium-webdriver` (or if you're using version `3.x`), all\nyou need to do is run the `extend` function on your webdriver instance:\n\n```js\n  var extendedWebdriver = require('webdriver-js-extender').extend(webdriver);\n\n  extendedWebdriver.setNetworkConnection(5);\n```\n",
