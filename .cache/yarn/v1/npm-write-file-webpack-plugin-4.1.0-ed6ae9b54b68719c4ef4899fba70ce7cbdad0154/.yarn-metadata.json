When not present, all bundle will be written.\n * @property {boolean} useHashIndex Use hash index to write only files that have changed since the last iteration (default: true).\n */\n\n/**\n * @param {options} options\n * @returns {Object}\n */\nnew WriteFilePlugin();\n\nnew WriteFilePlugin({\n    // Write only files that have \".css\" extension.\n    test: /\\.css$/,\n    useHashIndex: true\n});\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nConfigure [`webpack.config.js`](https://webpack.github.io/docs/configuration.html) to use the `write-file-webpack-plugin` plugin.\n\n```js\nimport path from 'path';\nimport WriteFilePlugin from 'write-file-webpack-plugin';\n\nexport default {\n    output: {\n        path: path.join(__dirname, './dist')\n    },\n    plugins: [\n        new WriteFilePlugin()\n    ],\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\nSee [./sandbox](./sandbox) for a working `webpack` configuration.\n",
